# DungeonCrawler

* Summary: 
A small dungeon crawler game developed for my class CS 1666 [PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER GAME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION].
The project was developed within a group of 12 people, then further divided into groups of 4 to tackle advanced topics that would be implemented within the game.
In regards to that I assisted the team in charge of implementing procedural generation into the game. Specifically doing a good amount of work for the code responsible for level generation.

* Goal: The goal of the course was to effectively teach students how to work in a group environment as well as manage a team. We received very little guidance aside from occasional
feedback from the teacher and were left to set our own weekly goals and progress development with our project on our own. All to deliver the final executable within 12 weeks time.
In addition, we needed to implement 3 advanced topics into our program to make it beyond a simple point and click game. For that we chose to focus on developing AI that chooses what enemies to throw at the player,
procedural level generation to change how floors in the dungeon look as a player moves on, and networking capabilities to allow players to play together.

* System Requirements: Due to the limited time frame of development for the project we did not have time to implement cross platform compatibility. As a result the program can only properly compile and execute in its final state on linux machines.
